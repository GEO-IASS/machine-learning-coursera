#ANN training
##Cost function
- L = total number of layers in network
- s_l = num of units (not counting bias) in layer l
- Cost function is from logistic regression

##Backpropagation
- Used to minimise J(theta)
- Need code to compute J(theta) and partial derivatives of J(theta)
- Backproprogate the error back by finding the error in the last activation layer and the desired output
