# Machine Learning basics

- Computer program learns from experience E wrt some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised learning

- Give the 'right answers' to the algorithm: example data is labelled
- Regression problem: predict continuous valued output
- Classification problem: discrete valued output

## Unsupervised learning

- Dataset is not labled
